# Getting Started with ReplayCraft

ReplayCraft is an innovative Minecraft Bedrock Edition add-on that enables players to record build actions performed in the game and play them back cinematic cameras. Follow this guide to ensure everything is set up correctly.

## Required Experimental Features

ReplayCraft utilizes cutting-edge features from the 2.3.0-Beta server and 2.1.0-Beta server-ui APIs. To enable these features, make sure the following experimental toggle is activated in your world settings:

- Scripting API


![ScriptingAPI](Media\enableapi.png)

!> Without this toggle, the add-on will not function properly.

## Resource Pack
ReplayCraft includes a custom resource pack, which is essential for the addon to work.
Ensure the resource pack is applied to your world, realm, or server before you start.

## Skin Resource Pack
We have now split the resource pack, this means we each update you no longer have to re create a skin pack. Skin packs allow you to upload your custom skin file which can then be applied to the replay entity. You can upload 64 skin files and the resource pack tool will create you skin pack to apply to your world, realm or server.

!> We can only support classic skin files. You will need to create a classic skin.

## Behavior Pack
The behavior pack is another essential component of ReplayCraft. It includes
all the scripting required to make the mod functional is contained within this pack.

!> Applying the Packs
Make sure both the Resource Pack and the Behavior Pack are installed and applied.

With everything in place, you're ready to explore the possibilities of custom replay's in Minecraft using ReplayCraft.

## Control items
Once you have loaded your world you can use the slash command `/controls` and you will be given the custom items.

## Capturing a replay
To get started you need to use the replay stick to open the menu and select new replay you will then be prompted to enter a name once completed the system starts recording the players actions and movement. Once you have completed the build select stop recording.

## After Capturing a replay
At this point you will notice all the blocks have been removed this is normal, the data has been saved to the world file so it can be played back. Your work has not been lost.

The next step is to set camera points this can be done via the load frame seconds or load frame ticks option. For most users Seconds is more user friendly. Once you have selected how many seconds to load it will load the data and you can then add a camera point. 

## Final Step.
Now its time to record your screen, you will start the playback and the playback entity will load in and start replaying your actions. This is done in real time if you are creating a time lapse you can then speed up the footage in your preferred editing software.
